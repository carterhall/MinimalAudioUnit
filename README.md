# MinimalAudioUnit
An *extremely* minimal Audio Unit example in C, built at the command line, without touching Xcode.

It does not actually function in any way - this simply demonstrates what you need to do to build the AU, register the factory function, and reach initialization. In order to actually work in a DAW, you'll need to respond to more of the dispatch functions via `Lookup`. The output of `auval` should make it clear what is missing.

The Info.plist has some fields that you will need to modify to make a new plugin:
- Change all instances of `MinimalAU` to your plugin name.
- Make sure the `factoryFunction` field reflects the name of your actual factory function.
- Change the 'subtype' `Mini` to something else. I believe these need to be globally unique - 'subtype' is not a great name, it's really a unique ID for your plugin.
- Change the last 4 characters in `PkgInfo` to reflect the new subtype.
- Change the manufacturer code to a 4-letter string that uniquely identifies your company. I believe this needs to start with a capital letter, but don't quote me on that.
- As needed, change version numbers, supported macOS version, etc.

If your plugin needs additional permissions, you may need to add them to the `Info.plist`. This would normally be generated by Xcode. I'd recommend looking at some existing `Info.plist`s from other plugins to figure this out.
